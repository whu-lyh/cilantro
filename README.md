[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kzampog/cilantro.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kzampog/cilantro) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/cilantro/badge/?version=latest)](http://cilantro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/kzampog/cilantro.svg)](https://codedocs.xyz/kzampog/cilantro/)

`cilantro` is a lean and fast C++ library for working with point cloud data, with emphasis given to the 3D case.
It includes efficient implementations for a variety of common operations, providing a clean API and attempting to minimize the amount of boilerplate code.
The library is extensively templated, enabling operations on data of arbitrary numerical type and dimensionality (where applicable) and featuring a modular/extensible design of the more complex procedures.
At the same time, convenience aliases/wrappers for the most common cases are provided.
A high-level description of `cilantro` can be found in our [technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.00399).

## Supported functionality

#### Basic operations:
- General dimension kd-trees (using bundled [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann))
- Surface normal and curvature estimation from raw point clouds
- General dimension grid-based point cloud resampling
- Principal Component Analysis
- Basic I/O utilities for 3D point clouds (in PLY format, using bundled [tinyply](https://github.com/ddiakopoulos/tinyply)) and Eigen matrices
- RGBD image pair to/from point cloud conversion utilities

#### Convex hulls:
- A general dimension convex polytope representation that is computed (using bundled [Qhull](http://www.qhull.org/)) from either vertex or half-space intersection input and allows for easy switching between the respective representations
- A representation of generic (general dimension) space regions as unions of convex polytopes that implements set operations

#### Clustering:
- General dimension k-means clustering that supports all distance metrics supported by [nanoflann](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann)
- Spectral clustering based on various graph Laplacian types (using bundled [Spectra](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra))
- Mean-shift clustering with custom kernel support
- Connected component based point cloud segmentation that supports arbitrary point-wise similarity functions

#### Geometric registration:
- Multiple generic Iterative Closest Point implementations that support arbitrary correspondence search methods in arbitrary point feature spaces for:
    - **Rigid** or **affine** alignment under the point-to-point metric (general dimension), point-to-plane metric (2D or 3D), or any combination thereof
    - **Non-rigid** alignment of 2D or 3D point sets, by means of a robustly regularized, **locally rigid** or **locally affine** deformation field, under any combination of the point-to-point and point-to-plane metrics; implementations for both *densely* and *sparsely* (similarly to [DynamicFusion](http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dynamicfusion/)) supported warp fields are provided

#### Robust model estimation:
- A RANSAC estimator template and instantiations thereof for general dimension:
    - Robust hyperplane estimation
    - Rigid point cloud registration given noisy correspondences

#### Visualization:
- Classical Multidimensional Scaling (using bundled [Spectra](https://github.com/yixuan/spectra) for eigendecompositions)
- A powerful, extensible, and easy to use 3D visualizer

## Dependencies
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) (3.3 or newer) [**required**]
- [Pangolin](https://github.com/stevenlovegrove/Pangolin) (built with Eigen enabled) [**optional**; needed for visualization modules and most examples]

## Building
`cilantro` is developed and tested on Ubuntu 14.04, 16.04, and 18.04 variants using [CMake](https://cmake.org/).
Please note that you may have to manually set up a recent version of Eigen on Ubuntu 14.04, as the one provided in the official repos is outdated.
To clone and build the library (with bundled examples), execute the following in a terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/kzampog/cilantro.git
cd cilantro
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

## Documentation
Documentation ([readthedocs.io](http://cilantro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest), [Doxygen API documentation](https://codedocs.xyz/kzampog/cilantro/)) is a work in progress.
The short provided examples (built by default) cover a significant part of the library's functionality.
Most of them expect a single command-line argument (path to a point cloud file in PLY format).
One such input is bundled in `examples/test_clouds` for quick testing.

## License
The library is released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/kzampog/cilantro/blob/master/LICENSE).
